Eye-Tracker: ML approach for autonomic nervous system activation monitoring


This work is inserted in the scope of the technology for ocular tracking, a tech that is used to record the dimension and the movement of the pupils.
The final goal for this approach would be a machine learning algorithm able to precept in real time the ANS behaviour in the detected signal of the subject, providing a metrics for the Arousal explicated by the subject itself according to different stimuli.
In this project, I implemented an offline analysis pipeline to inspect the significance of the data and a preliminary training of the model created on inter-subject recordings.

Eye-Tracker: A Machine Learning Approach to Monitor Activation of the Autonomic Nervous System


This work is inserted in the scope of the technology for ocular tracking, a tech that is used to record the dimensions and the movement of the pupils.
The final goal for this approach would be a machine learning algorithm able to precept in real time the ANS behavior in the detected signal of the subject, providing metrics for the Arousal explicated by the subject itself according to different stimuli.
In this project, I implemented an offline analysis pipeline to inspect the significance of the data and preliminary training of the model created on inter-subject recordings.
